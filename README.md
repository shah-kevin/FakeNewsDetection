# FakeNewsDetection
Applied a Supervised Passive aggresive Classifier on data from Fake News to train the model and created a front end in Flask to be able to consume that model.
Feel free to reach out for questions:kev22nov@gmail.com
Run the FakeNewsNet.py file to see the flask front end in action. The model is trained on 2016 news datasets and is for demo purposes only.
